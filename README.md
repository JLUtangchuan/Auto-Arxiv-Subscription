**arxiv-rss:** daily query for new arXiv articles in select topics via RSS

[Daily, De-Duplicated arXiv RSS Updates: Keyword Parsed, Plus Non-Parsed Content](https://persagen.com/2019/06/10/arxiv-rss.html)

* A BASH script for daily retrieval of new, de-duplicated content from preselected arXiv groups.  That content is parsed into two files: keyword-matched articles of interest, plus the remaining articles.

  * As a crude measure of utility, I typically click (Vim: `gx` keypress) perhaps 2% of links in a "arxiv-others" results file and perhaps 20% of links in a "arxiv-filtered") file, a â‰¥10-fold enrichment in articles of interest.

* The script can be scheduled to run daily via crontab, or manually executed.

* If you have desktop notification (e.g. Linux `notify-send`), then a persistent message will indicate the arrival of new content

  * [ *See the [Addendum](#addendum) for a an approach to easier notifications, reading.* ]

**Addendum** [2021-02-11]

I've been running this `BASH` script daily for over a year.

Rather than opening the raw plain-text files, I found it easier each morning to retrieve those results via email, from which I review articles-of-interest in `Firefox` (those links opened directly from the two daily email messages).

The plain-text messages include URLs to the arXiv article `abs` landing pages (or `pdf`, if you prefer), which are recognized as such by my email client.

The `BASH` script - which I schedule via `crontab` - includes code near the bottom of the script for the emailing (via `mutt`) of those results, which I read in `Claws Mail`.
