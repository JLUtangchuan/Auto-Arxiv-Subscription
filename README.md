***Note:** At various times I've updated the [`arxiv-rss.sh`](https://github.com/victoriastuart/arxiv-rss/blob/master/arxiv-rss.sh) script, mainly to address date-related bugs interfering with the daily checks / downloads.*

Current version (shown in [`arxiv-rss.sh`](https://github.com/victoriastuart/arxiv-rss/blob/master/arxiv-rss.sh) header): **13**

# arxiv-rss
Daily query for new arXiv articles in select topics via RSS

Description: https://Persagen.com/2019/06/10/arxiv-rss.html

  * [Daily, De-Duplicated arXiv RSS Updates: Keyword Parsed, Plus Non-Parsed Content](https://persagen.com/2019/06/10/arxiv-rss.html)

**TL//DR**

* I provide a BASH script, [`arxiv-rss.sh`](https://persagen.com/files/misc/arxiv-rss.sh) [&larr; direct download link] for daily retrieval of new, de-duplicated content from preselected arXiv groups.  That content is parsed into two files: keyword-matched articles of interest, plus the remaining articles.

  * As a crude measure of utility, I typically click (Vim: `gx` keypress) perhaps 2% of links in a "arxiv-others" results file and perhaps 10-20% of links in a "arxiv-filtered") file, a â‰¥5-fold enrichment in articles of interest.

* The script can be scheduled to run daily via crontab, or manually executed.

* If you have desktop notification (e.g. Linux `notify-send`), then a persistent message will indicate the arrival of new content
